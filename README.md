## Welcome to Clean  Commerce 

Clean Commerce is a microservices-based e-commerce platform that includes a <b>User Service</b> for user registration and managing, a <b>Payment Service</b> for managing billing addresses and card information, both operating with gRPC protocol.
<p>
And one <b>API Gateway</b> service to facilitates communication between these services, handling HTTP requests and routing them appropriately.
</p>
<p>
Currently, users can register, add billing addresses, and manage credit card information through the payment service, while authentication processes are in development to enhance security.
</p>

- Microsservices
- Clean Architecture

### Architecture

In this project, I decided to implements <b>Clean Architecture</b>, a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, ensuring that the system's core logic is uncoupled from external frameworks, user interfaces, and databases, which promotes maintainability and testability.
```mermaid
graph LR
A -- Instance -->D{Database} 
A(Repository) -- Implements--> B
B[Interface Adapter] -- Receive --> C(UseCases)
C --> E(Business Rule)

subgraph  Frameworks and Drivers
A
D
end

subgraph  Interfaces
B
end

subgraph  Core
C
E
end
```
I also decided to use a <b>microservices-based architecture</b> in the project, which structures the application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for specific business functions, enabling independent development, deployment, and scalability.
```mermaid
graph LR
E(Client) -- HTTP Request --> A
A[API Gateway] -- gRPC Request --> B(Payment Service)
A -- gRPC Request --> C(User Service)
B --> D{Database}
C --> F{Database}
```
###   Installation
<p>To install the application, the docker and docker-compose must be installed correctly on your machine</p><p>The application will start on localhost <b>(127.0.0.1)</b> on <b>8000 port</b>, the mysql will start on <b>3306 port</b>, and the microsservices will use the <b>50051</b> and <b>50052</b> ports, make sure these ports are free before starting the installation.</p>
<p>1. Enter on project folder: </p>

```
cd clean_commerce
```
<p>2. Now we will run the containers using docker-compose:</p>  

```
docker-compose up
```
<p>3. Now we need to run the migrations with the following command: </p>

``` 
make migrate 
```
#### Troubleshooting issue
If you encounter issues during the installation of the project, itâ€™s possible that the containers may fail to start due to database connectivity problems. In such cases, please try the following steps:

1.  Ensure that the database service is running correctly.
2.  Restart the containers using the following command:
```
docker-compose down
```
```
docker-compose up
```
### Testing

The following layers are covered by automated tests:

-   <b>Users Repository:</b> `services > users > internal > infra > database`
-   <b>Card and Billing  Address Entities</b>: `services > payment > internal > entity`
-   <b>Card and Billing Address Repository: </b> `services > payment > internal > infra > database`

To run the tests, in the `/clean_commerce` directory run the following command : 
``` 
make test
```

To test the functionality in practice, a Postman collection has been made available in the `/docs` directory.
